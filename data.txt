1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post gifs that have already appeared on /r/gifs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the gif).  **[Duration must be less than or equal to twenty (≤20) seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/RXihRpT.png)**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***Nudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.***  If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Please mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.**

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.

2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the gif).  **[Duration must be less than or equal to twenty (≤20) seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/RXihRpT.png)**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***Nudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.***  If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Please mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.**

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.
